# Google Carton Faces

I've always wondered how artificial intelligence recreates our reality. So I decided to do my own research and learn it. This is how my project was born. In the ipynb file shared here you can find the model (discriminator and generator) and the functions that I used to teach the AI ​​to create new google cartoon faces based on the dataset below.
